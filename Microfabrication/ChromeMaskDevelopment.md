## MATERIALS

## BEFORE STARTING
Check the dilution date of the photoresist development solution. If the solution is more than 3 weeks old, you have to resplenish it by making a new solution (dilution : 1/3 with DI water)

## Photoresist etching

1. Fill a large beaker (height : 2 to 3 cm) with the photoresist developer

The photoresist developer should be diluted at a 1/3 fraction with DI water

If the diluted solution is older than 3 weeks, the solution should be disposed and renewed
2. Take the printed mask out from  the Heidelberg ÂµPG 101

3. Insert the mask inside the developped, with the photoresist face up. Shake the beaked intermitently and let the developer act for 2 min 30.

4. Take out the mask from the beaker and rinse thorouhgly with DI water. Dry it with the N2/Air gun.

5. Dispose the developer and the rinsing solution in the dedicated waster container.

## Chrome etching

6. Fill a large beaker (height : 2 to 3 cm) with chrome etchant solution.

The etching solution is re-usable, and should be resplenished after XX usages.

7. Insert the mask in the beaker and wait for 1 min for the Chrome to be etched

8. Rinse thoroughly the mask with DI water and dry it with the N2/Air gun

9. Using another large beaker, rinse the mask with acetone to remove the resist

10. Finally, rinse the mask with isopropyl alcohol and dry it with the N2/Air gun
