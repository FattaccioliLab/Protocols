## Protocol

1. Cut your PDMS in little squares of a typical thickness of 7mm. The surface should be between 1.5*1.5 cm and 5*5 cm.
2. Clean it with scotch to make sure there is no dust
3. Put it in the plasma cleaner for at least 10 min (without plasma) to remove air
Alternative way : vacuum bell jar overnight
4. During this time, take the epoxy
5. Blow air on the bottle to remove white dried stuff
6. Weight the Epoxy (Ratio is 1:2)

For a big petri dish :■ 30 g of hardener■ 60 g of epoxy

For a regular petri dish :■ 10 g of hardener■ 20 g of expoxy

7. Mix it in a transparent cup with a plastic pipette
8. Make sure it is well mix (it becomes transparent again)
9. Pour the mix in the dish, in a place where you can keep the dish and not move it for a day
10. Wait for the bubbles to disappear (you can blow on them with a transfer pipet). Alternative : vacuum bell jar for 15 min
11. Take the PDMS out of the plasma chamber
12. With one hand take the PDMS from the glass slide
13. Put the PDMS in the «dirty» hand
14. Immerse slowly the PDMS in the epoxy with an angle to avoid bubbles between the PDMS and the epoxy. The PDMS will float
15. Let the expoxy polymerize for a day at room temperature (it wll get quite hot, so don't put another epoxy filled dish on top of another).
16. Remove gently the PDMS pieces which can't be used for experiments (epoxy has diffused in the structure).
17. For a week, the epoxy mold shouldn't go into the oven (cure the PDMs at R.T for 24 hours). If the oven is needed, be sure that the epoxy is back at room temperature before taking PDMS out in order not to damage the structure.
