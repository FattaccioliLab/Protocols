# Couette Emulsification of Soybean Oil in Water droplets

## Preliminary steps

First have to be prepared :

-100g of PEF 68 30% w/w (4h agitation at 60°)

-25g of sodium alginate 4%w/w (agitation over night)

## Protocol

1. Mix droplet by droplet with a baguette:
- 2.5g of PEF 68
- 2.5g of the solution of alginate
- 15g of soybean

2. Put on Couette cell and weight the cream.

3. Add water to have 1%w/w of PEF in the solution.

4. Add 1%w/w PEF 68 to have 5%w/w of oil in the solution.

5. Decantate one night then get the oil phase. Add 100g of PEF 1%w/w and decantate again one night. Do it three times.

6. Then store the emulsion at 10°C.
